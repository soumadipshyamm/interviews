What are the four principles of OOP?
The four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods together.
Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
Inheritance – Deriving new classes from existing ones.
Polymorphism – One interface, multiple implementations.
