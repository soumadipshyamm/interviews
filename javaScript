Concept	Definition	Example
Class	Blueprint for objects	class Car { }
Object	Instance of a class	$myCar = new Car();
Encapsulation	Hides data, allows controlled access	private $balance; with getBalance()
Abstraction	Hides implementation details	abstract class Vehicle {}
Inheritance	One class inherits another	class Dog extends Animal {}
Polymorphism	Multiple behaviors using the same method	overloading and overriding
Method Overloading	Same method name, different parameters (Not in PHP)	Simulated using __call()
Method Overriding	Child class modifies parent method	class Child extends Parent {}



What are the four principles of OOP?
The four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only important parts.
Encapsulation hides data to prevent unauthorized access.

Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods together.
Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
abstract class Animal {
    abstract public function makeSound();
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Bark";
    }
}
Inheritance – Deriving new classes from existing ones.
Polymorphism – One interface, multiple implementations.


What is final keyword, and how does it work?
✅ Answer:
The final keyword prevents class inheritance and method overriding.

 What is an interface, and how is it different from an abstract class?
✅ Answer:
An interface defines method signatures without implementation. A class implementing an interface must define all its methods.

interface Animal {
    public function makeSound();
}
class Dog implements Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Bark";
    }
}


Function Overriding: A child class redefines a parent method.
Function Overloading: Same method name, different parameters (not supported in PHP).

class ParentClass {
    public function greet() {
        return "Hello from Parent";
    }
}
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    public function greet() {
        return "Hello from Child";
    }
}
