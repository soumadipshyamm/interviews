 What are the four pillars of OOP?
✅ Answer:

Encapsulation – Hiding data using access modifiers (public, private, protected).
Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and showing only the necessary functionality.
Inheritance – Allowing one class to inherit the properties and methods of another.
Polymorphism – Allowing methods to have different behaviors based on the object.



<?php
// **Encapsulation** – Hiding data using access modifiers (public, private, protected)
class Vehicle {
    protected $brand;  // Protected property, accessible in child classes

    public function __construct($brand) {
        $this->brand = $brand;
    }

    // Getter method (Encapsulation)
    public function getBrand() {
        return $this->brand;
    }
}

// **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details and showing only necessary functionality
abstract class Car extends Vehicle {
    protected $model;

    public function __construct($brand, $model) {
        parent::__construct($brand);
        $this->model = $model;
    }

    abstract public function getCarInfo(); // Abstract method (must be implemented in child classes)
}

// **Inheritance** – Allowing one class to inherit properties and methods of another
class Sedan extends Car {
    private $topSpeed;

    public function __construct($brand, $model, $topSpeed) {
        parent::__construct($brand, $model);
        $this->topSpeed = $topSpeed;
    }

    // Implementing abstract method (Abstraction)
    public function getCarInfo() {
        return "Brand: " . $this->brand . ", Model: " . $this->model . ", Top Speed: " . $this->topSpeed . " km/h";
    }
}

// **Polymorphism** – Allowing methods to have different behaviors based on the object
class SUV extends Car {
    private $groundClearance;

    public function __construct($brand, $model, $groundClearance) {
        parent::__construct($brand, $model);
        $this->groundClearance = $groundClearance;
    }

    // Different implementation of getCarInfo (Polymorphism)
    public function getCarInfo() {
        return "Brand: " . $this->brand . ", Model: " . $this->model . ", Ground Clearance: " . $this->groundClearance . " mm";
    }
}

// Creating objects
$sedan = new Sedan("Toyota", "Camry", 240);
$suv = new SUV("Jeep", "Wrangler", 220);

// Displaying details (Polymorphism in action)
echo $sedan->getCarInfo() . "\n"; // Outputs: Brand: Toyota, Model: Camry, Top Speed: 240 km/h
echo $suv->getCarInfo() . "\n";   // Outputs: Brand: Jeep, Model: Wrangler, Ground Clearance: 220 mm
?>


What is a constructor in PHP OOP?
✅ Answer:
A constructor (__construct) is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize properties.

class Person {
    public $name;

    public function __construct($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}
$person1 = new Person("John");
echo $person1->name; // Output: John


What are access modifiers in PHP OOP?
✅ Answer:
Access modifiers control the visibility of properties and methods in a class:

public → Accessible from anywhere.
private → Accessible only within the class.
protected → Accessible within the class and its child classes.

What is method overriding in PHP OOP?
✅ Answer:
Method overriding occurs when a child class redefines a method inherited from the parent class.

class ParentClass {
    public function show() {
        return "Parent Method";
    }
}
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    public function show() {
        return "Child Method";
    }
}
$obj = new ChildClass();
echo $obj->show(); // Output: Child Method


What is method overloading in PHP?
✅ Answer:
PHP does not support true method overloading, but it can be simulated using magic methods (__call).

🔹 Example:
class Test {
    public function __call($name, $arguments) {
        return "Method $name does not exist!";
    }
}
$obj = new Test();
echo $obj->someMethod(); // Output: Method someMethod does not exist!


What is an interface in PHP OOP?
✅ Answer:
An interface defines methods that a class must implement, but does not provide implementation itself.

🔹 Example:
interface Animal {
    public function makeSound();
}
class Dog implements Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Bark";
    }
}
$dog = new Dog();
echo $dog->makeSound(); // Output: Bark

What is aggregation and association in OOP?
✅ Answer:

Association: Two classes are related but independent.
Aggregation: One class owns another but both can exist independently.
Composition: One class fully depends on another.
