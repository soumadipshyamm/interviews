Concept	One-liner Explanation
Dependency Injection	Inject class dependencies via constructor or resolve them using Laravel’s service container.
Class Object Construction	Use the app() helper or type-hint the class for automatic instantiation by Laravel.
Polymorphism	Define an interface, create multiple implementations, and bind them in the service container for flexible dependency resolution.



### **Laravel-Specific Questions**
15. **What is the Default Template You Use in Laravel?**  
    - Laravel uses Blade as its default templating engine.

** What is the Artisan ***
   - "Artisan is Laravel's command-line tool that automates tasks like generating code, running migrations, and managing the application."

16. **Uses of `composer.json`?**  
    - It defines dependencies and package configurations in a Laravel project.

17. **What is Localization in Laravel?**  
    - Localization allows translation of strings for multi-language support. Example:  
      ```php
      __('messages.welcome')
      ```

18. **How Does CSRF Token Work?**  
    - It prevents cross-site request forgery by verifying a unique token in form submissions.

19. **What is Eager Loading?**  
    - Eager loading loads related models with a query to improve performance.  
      ```php
      User::with('posts')->get();
      ```

20. **What Are Facades?**  
    - Facades provide a static interface to Laravel’s services. Example:  
      ```php
      use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
      Cache::put('key', 'value', 600);
      ```

21. **What is Reverse Routing in Laravel?**  
    - Reverse routing generates URLs based on route names.  
Reverse Routing is a feature in Laravel that allows you to generate URLs or redirects to named routes automatically.
      ```php
      route('user.profile', ['id' => 1]);
      ```

22. **What is Soft Delete and Delete in Laravel?**  
    - Soft delete marks a record as deleted but keeps it in the database (`deleted_at`).  
    - Delete removes the record permanently.

23. **Have You Created Middleware in Laravel?**  
    - Yes. Middleware filters HTTP requests. Example:  
      ```php
      php artisan make:middleware CheckAge
      ```


Here are the answers to your questions:

## **Laravel Questions**

1. **What databases does Laravel support?**  
   Laravel supports multiple databases, including:  
   - MySQL  
   - PostgreSQL  
   - SQLite  
   - SQL Server  

2. **How to define environment variables in Laravel?**  
   - You can define environment variables in the `.env` file:  
     ```
     APP_ENV=local
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=laravel_db
     DB_USERNAME=root
     DB_PASSWORD=
     ```

3. **How to enable maintenance mode in Laravel?**  
   - Use the Artisan command:  
     ```
     php artisan down
     ```
   - To disable maintenance mode:  
     ```
     php artisan up
     ```

4. **How to create middleware in Laravel?**  
   - Generate middleware:  
     ```
     php artisan make:middleware CheckUser
     ```
   - Define logic in `app/Http/Middleware/CheckUser.php`:  
     ```php
     public function handle($request, Closure $next)
     {
         if (auth()->user()->is_admin) {
             return $next($request);
         }
         return redirect('/');
     }
     ```
   - Register in `Kernel.php`.

5. **What is seeding?**  
   - Seeding is used to insert dummy data into the database. Example:  
     ```php
     DB::table('users')->insert([
         'name' => 'John Doe',
         'email' => 'john@example.com',
         'password' => bcrypt('password'),
     ]);
     ```
   - Run using:  
     ```
     php artisan db:seed
     ```

6. **Can we disable CSRF for a specific route?**  
   - Yes, by adding it to the `$except` array in `VerifyCsrfToken.php`:  
     ```php
     protected $except = [
         'payment/webhook',
     ];
     ```


Absolutely! Here's a **one-line answer** for each of your questions — perfect for interview quick-fire rounds:

---

1. **Laravel Service Container:**  
> "A powerful dependency injection container that manages class dependencies and performs automatic resolution."

2. **Service Provider Bootstrapping:**  
> "Service providers bootstrap application services and register bindings into the service container."

3. **Facade in Laravel:**  
> "Facades provide a static interface to classes in the service container while using dynamic resolution behind the scenes."

4. **Singleton vs Bind:**  
> "Singleton binds a class to a single shared instance, while bind resolves a new instance each time."

5. **Middleware:**  
> "Middleware filters HTTP requests and responses, and custom middleware can be created using `php artisan make:middleware`."

6. **Route Model Binding:**  
> "Automatically injects model instances into routes based on route parameters, either implicitly by type-hinting or explicitly using `Route::model()`."

7. **Events and Listeners:**  
> "Laravel's event system decouples code by dispatching events and handling them via listeners."

8. **Jobs and Queues:**  
> "Jobs represent units of work pushed to queues for deferred background processing."

9. **Task Scheduling:**  
> "Laravel uses a fluent `schedule` method inside `app/Console/Kernel.php` to define scheduled tasks, run by `schedule:run`."

10. **Repository Pattern:**  
> "Separates business logic from data access logic using interfaces and classes for better maintainability."

11. **Broadcasting with Pusher/Socket.io:**  
> "Laravel Broadcasting allows real-time events to be sent to client-side apps using drivers like Pusher or Socket.io."

12. **hasOneThrough vs. hasManyThrough:**  
> "HasOneThrough defines a single intermediate relation, while hasManyThrough defines multiple intermediate related models."

13. **Lazy vs. Eager vs. Lazy Eager Loading:**  
> "Lazy loads on access, eager loads upfront to reduce queries, and lazy eager loading loads after the initial query."

14. **Cache System:**  
> "Laravel supports multiple cache drivers (Redis, Memcached, etc.) and cache tagging for grouped cache management."

15. **API Rate Limiting:**  
> "Laravel uses rate limiting to control API request rates via the `ThrottleRequests` middleware."

16. **Policy vs. Gate:**  
> "Gates are closures for simple auth checks, while policies are classes that organize authorization logic."

17. **Multi-Authentication:**  
> "Laravel allows multiple authentication guards for managing different user types."

18. **tap() Helper:**
