### **Laravel-Specific Questions**

    - Laravel uses Blade as its default templating engine.

** What is the Artisan ***
   - "Artisan is Laravel's command-line tool that automates tasks like generating code, running migrations, and managing the application."

16. **Uses of `composer.json`?**  
    - It defines dependencies and package configurations in a Laravel project.

17. **What is Localization in Laravel?**

18. **How Does CSRF Token Work?**  
    - It prevents cross-site request forgery by verifying a unique token in form submissions.

19. **What is Eager Loading?**  
    - Eager loading loads related models with a query to improve performance.  
      ```php
      User::with('posts')->get();
      ```

20. **What Are Facades?**  
    - Facades provide a static interface to Laravel’s services. Example:  
      ```php
      use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
      Cache::put('key', 'value', 600);
      ```

21. **What is Reverse Routing in Laravel?**  
    - Reverse routing generates URLs based on route names.  
Reverse Routing is a feature in Laravel that allows you to generate URLs or redirects to named routes automatically.
      ```php
      route('user.profile', ['id' => 1]);
      ```

22. **What is Soft Delete and Delete in Laravel?**  
    - Soft delete marks a record as deleted but keeps it in the database (`deleted_at`).  
    - Delete removes the record permanently.

23. **Have You Created Middleware in Laravel?**  
    - Yes. Middleware filters HTTP requests. Example:  
      ```php
